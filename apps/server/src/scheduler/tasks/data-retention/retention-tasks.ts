/**
 * Tables cleared by the data-retention scheduler. Edit this list to change the
 * cleanup surface — no config file, no enum, no Zod schema. Developers know
 * which tables are logs/metrics/caches and which are Agent memory.
 *
 * Intentionally NOT cleaned up (not in this list):
 * - `linear_message_ledger` — Story Agent's source-of-truth message ledger
 * - `story` / `story_memory_document` — Agent long-term memory
 * - `root_agent_runtime_snapshot` / `story_agent_runtime_snapshot` — runtime snapshots
 * - `oauth_session` — persistent auth state
 * - `news_article` / `news_feed_cursor` — RSS articles (see TODOS.md for deferred strategy)
 * - `metric_chart` — chart definitions (meta, not data)
 *
 * Field choices worth noting:
 * - `metric` uses `createdAt`, not `occurredAt`. The latter is only indexed as the
 *   trailing column of the composite `(metric_name, occurred_at)` index, so a
 *   single-column `occurred_at < x` predicate cannot seek it.
 * - `auth_usage_snapshot` keeps 30 days (not 7) so the `/auth/:provider/usage-trend`
 *   window stays usable.
 * - `embedding_cache` keeps 30 days to avoid evicting hot hash hits that would
 *   trigger re-embed API calls.
 * - `oauth_state` uses `expiresAt` because it has a single-column index; `createdAt`
 *   does not. Since a state row expires ~10 minutes after creation, `expiresAt < now - 7d`
 *   is equivalent to `createdAt < now - 7d` in practice.
